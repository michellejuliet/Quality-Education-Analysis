<h2> Quality Education Analysis </h2>
Step 1: Understand the Problem and Context 
Objective: Help Nairobi County prioritize investments to improve equitable access to quality education in primary schools, aligning with SDG 4.
Focus Areas: 
- Infrastructure and resource gaps in primary schools. - Geographic and demographic disparities in access to quality education.
Step 2: Analyze the Data 
Education Facilities Data: - Assess infrastructure indicators such as school capacity, classroom sizes, teacher-student ratios, and geo-locations. - Identify schools with limited infrastructure or overcrowding issues. Kenya Population and Housing Census: - Analyze demographic data to identify areas with higher populations of school-age children. - Investigate socioeconomic disparities and their potential impact on access to education.
Step 3: Hypotheses Development 
Initial Hypotheses: - Schools in densely populated areas may have insufficient infrastructure. - Socioeconomically disadvantaged areas have fewer well-resourced schools. - Geographic distribution of schools might not align with population density.
Step 4: Perform the Analysis 
Use Python for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. Libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and GeoPandas can be particularly useful. Analyze: - Accessibility: Map schools relative to population density. - Infrastructure Gaps: Highlight discrepancies in facilities like classroom numbers, electricity, or sanitation. - Equity: Examine disparities in education access based on socioeconomic or geographic factors.
Step 5: Prepare Insights and Recommendations 
Slide Structure:
Cover Slide: Project title, date, and your details. Introduction: Problem statement, objectives, and key questions. Data Summary: Overview of datasets, key metrics, and assumptions. Analysis Results: Visualize geographic and demographic disparities. Highlight critical gaps in school infrastructure and resources. Recommendations: Prioritized list of actions based on the analysis (e.g., investment in specific schools/areas). Practical steps for implementation (aligned with SDGs). Conclusion: Summarize key findings and emphasize actionable points.

Step 6: Document Code
Ensure the code is modular, well-documented, and clean. Include comments explaining data cleaning steps, assumptions, and calculations. Prepare a README file summarizing how the code works and what it achieves.
